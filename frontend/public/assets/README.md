# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding the Vedanta Logo

To complete the branding setup, please add your Vedanta logo image to this folder:

**File location:** `frontend/public/assets/vedanta-logo.png`

**Recommended specifications:**
- Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- Size: At least 200x200 pixels for high quality
- File name: `vedanta-logo.png`

The logo will automatically display on:
- Landing page (header and hero section)
- Login page
- Footer

If the logo file is not found, the pages will fall back to a book icon.
